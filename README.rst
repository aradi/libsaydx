SAYDX — Structured Array Data Exchange
**************************************

The saydx ([səeɪdɪks]) library implements a simple platform to exchange array
data using a simple tree structure. It offers a framework to build, to
manipulate and to query such array data trees as well as send and receive them
through various transport layers. It is written in C and provides also Fortran
interfaces.
